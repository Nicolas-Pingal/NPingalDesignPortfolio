## Nicolas Pingal: Design Portfolio

### About Me
I'm a third-year student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, studying Computer Science. I assembled this portolio of projects from Human-Computer Interfaces, a class focused on UX design. This class was a fascinating and eye-opening look into the world of designing interfaces, and I look forward to applying what I've learned to future projects.
